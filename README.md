# hello-world
My first attempt at learning a computer language 
My name is Ruthchneidy and I'm a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts with a double major in Developing Markets and Social Innovation and Communications. I hope to build a career in social impact consulting, teaming up non-profit organizations with private corporations to help develop communities and create a more sustainable world. I enjoy running, reading, and cooking. Why did I decide to learn Python? Why not?
